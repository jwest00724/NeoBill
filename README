PLEASE NOTE:
The development of SolidState has been relaunched recently. The current commit 
in the trunc is a beta development release of SolidState v0.5. It uses a new 
configuration file format and a new database scheme which both might change 
until the release of v0.5 without update/upgrade support. An update/upgrade 
will be provided for v0.4.z.r and maybe v0.5 alpha.
