 *
 * This file contains a set of basic configuration variables that are needed to
 * run SolidState.  More (most) configuration options are stored in the datbase,
 * and can be set through the "Administration > Settings" page.
 *
 * Database configuration:
 *
 *   $db['host']     - This is the host that your MySQL database server runs on
 *   $db['user']     - Database user with access to the SolidState database
 *   $db['pass']     - Password for the database user
 *   $db['database'] - The name of the database that SolidState will be using.
 *
 * Order/Signup Interface configuration:
 *
 *   $order_conf['url'] - The URL where you are installing SolidState.  If you are
 *                        installing a remote Order/Signup interface, then this is the
 *                        URL where your Manager interface is installed.
 *   $order_conf['remote_username'] - This is the user that the Order interface will
 *                                    use to authenticate to the remote server.  It
 *                                    can be configured in the manager under
 *                                    Administration > Settings > Order Interface
